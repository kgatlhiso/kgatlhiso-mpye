<p> we love food in this place <b> especially sushi</b> you must eat sushi.because if you dont eat sushi you will be <mark> kicked out.</mark> by the age of 4 years you mut be able to use chop sticks the reason for this is because kgatlhi loves sushi and beleives that we should all eat and enjoy the sushi that is made and also dont forget the <b> Poke bowls</b> basically they are sushi ingredients all in a bowl. most definetly can not forget about the dumpling saterdays but on friday is sushi feats day everybody must never forget that sushi is kgatlhi's <b>favorate food</b> and her second favorate food is pizza we always <mark> love pizza</mark> sundays its the best unlike eating the same foods every day</p>
